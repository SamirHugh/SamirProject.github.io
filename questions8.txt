Q1: The variable of dx and dy are the difference in the coordinates in which dx represents the x1-x0 and dy represents y1-y0 basically like a slope formula. 
Q2: The function that can be used to to graph would be the plotting function. 
Q3: The three forms of a string that the setcellcolor is able take on are rgb, hexadecimal, and color names.
Q4: The man command that can be used to get the tranquillity buttons are man button.
Q5: The puts() command writes the string s and trailing newline to stdout
    Floors function returns the largest integral value that is not greater than x so for floor(0.5) it would be 0
    The sin function returns the sine of x where x is given in radians if X represents NaN, NaN will be returned.
Q6: The code prompted me to input the x0,y0,x1,y1. What was shown was two points of the x0 and y0, then x1 and y1. 
Q7: 
Q8: My expected output was the same as the actual output
Expected output:
5         
4         
3       x 0 
2  0 x      
1         
 1 2 3 4 5
Actual output:
5         
4         
3       x 0 
2  0 x      
1         
 1 2 3 4 5
 Q9: 
 Expected output:
5     x    
4    0     
3       
2     
1 0       
x 1 2 3 4 5
Actual output:
5     x    
4         
3        
2   0     
1 0       
x 1 2 3 4 5
I believe that it went wrong is that in the algorithm in the part where we are labeling the slope, the slope isnt eligble to exceed 1 or else it's not graphable. 
Q10: I have recorded (4,4)(8,6), (3,2)(12,8), and (5,5)(10,6) and since their slope is less than one they worked. (All of the slope of them were below 1 so they all worked)
